      <header>That Time I Took a Black Cab in Sichuan
        <span><br/>02 February 2025</span>
      </header>

      <p>It was 2010, and we were somewhere in Western China trying to get to a small town on the Tibetan border. There was no bus, and no taxi would take us there. We had reservations for the night, so we started to get desperate to find a ride.</p>

      <p>My friend Adrian spoke enough Mandarin to get us into trouble, and we finally found an unlicensed driver to take the three of us there for a reasonable price. I had never used a black cab before, but it sounded above board, and we wouldnâ€™t pay until we arrived.</p>

      <p>The ride was gorgeous - Western Sichuan is breathtaking - and it was just us Americans and a few orange-robed monks, chatting as best we could. The driver told us we could listen to our own music, so of course I put some Tom Waits on and gleefully sang along in my best gravel-voiced impression. This amused the monks to no end. They laughed and laughed before finally switching it to more traditional Tibetan music.</p>

      <p>It was at this point things started to go wrong.</p>
