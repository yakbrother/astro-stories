    Curious thing about lost pages â€” they're never where you expect them to be,
    yet always exactly where they ought to be, which is somewhere else entirely.
    That's the philosophy of error messages, as near as I can figure.

    You might try checking your spelling. I knew a fellow once who spent three
    years looking for New Orleans because he kept asking for "New Or-leens."
    When he finally got the pronunciation right, turned out he'd been within
    spitting distance the whole time.

    But I'm not sure that's the case with this one. It seems to be stuck
    somewhere in the middle of a forest of tags and links.
