Armed with a new AI translation app, I felt prepared to hitchhike across Europe. The app promised "real-time conversation in 50 languages." What it delivered was chaos in every language imaginable.

In Germany, I tried to say "I'm heading to Berlin" but the app translated it to "I am a professional yodeling instructor seeking apprentices." This led to an unexpected two-hour detour to an Alpine singing competition.

The situation peaked in Italy when my request for a ride to Rome was translated as "I am a trained circus seal looking for my unicycle." Surprisingly, this got me a ride immediately - with a traveling circus. They seemed disappointed when I couldn't balance a ball on my nose, but were kind enough to drop me off at the next town.

I now travel with just two tools: a paper map and a smile. Though I still occasionally get job offers from circuses.
