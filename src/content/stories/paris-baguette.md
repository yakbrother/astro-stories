I didn't mean to cause an international incident. All I did was ask for my baguette to be cut into squares instead of the traditional diagonal slices. The baker gasped so dramatically I thought he was auditioning for the Paris Opera. The old lady behind me crossed herself with her croissant.

Within minutes, a crowd had gathered outside the boulangerie. Half were protesting my geometric heresy, the other half were curious revolutionaries demanding "Le Pain Carré." Someone started singing La Marseillaise, but with lyrics about bread shapes.

The mayor had to make a public statement about "preserving the cultural integrity of French bread geometry." I'm now banned from 47 bakeries and have a photo of my face crossed out with a baguette in their windows. On the bright side, I've been offered asylum by a rebellious gluten-free café in the Marais.
