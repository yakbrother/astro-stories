They say you can find anything in a Tokyo vending machine, and after my adventure last week, I'm inclined to agree. I was trying to find my way back to my hotel when I stumbled into what I can only describe as a vending machine forest. There were machines selling everything from live crabs to business suits.

I spent three hours "exploring" (read: completely lost) this mechanical marketplace. I bought a tie for my cat, a can of hot coffee that tasted suspiciously like disappointment, and what I thought was a sandwich but turned out to be a phone case shaped like a sandwich.

The strangest part? I swear one of the machines was following me. Every time I turned around, there it was, offering me increasingly specific products. "Slightly damp umbrella?" No thanks. "Left-handed chopsticks?" I'll pass. "Map to your hotel?" ...wait, come back!
