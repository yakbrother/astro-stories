As a software engineer, I thought I could optimize hitchhiking using machine learning. I created an algorithm that calculated the perfect thumb angle, smile intensity, and cardboard sign font for maximum ride probability. I even factored in variables like "driver empathy quotient" and "car-to-beard-trust ratio."

My app suggested I should stand on one leg, wear a rainbow unicorn onesie, and hold my sign upside down for optimal results. According to my calculations, this would yield a 94.3% success rate. Three hours later, I was still standing there, watching cars speed by while my phone insisted this was "peak hitchhiking efficiency."

The only ride I got that day was from an elderly lady who thought I was part of a circus that had lost its transport. She spent the entire journey telling me about her grandson who "also does computer things." I've since deleted the app and gone back to the traditional method: looking pathetically hopeful while holding a cardboard sign.
