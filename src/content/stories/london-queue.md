It started innocently enough. I saw a line forming and, being a temporary Londoner, naturally joined it. Nobody knew what we were queuing for, but that didn't matter - the act of queuing itself was enough. When we reached the front, it turned out to be the queue for joining other queues.

Throughout the day, I found myself inadvertently joining queues for: a bus that wasn't running, a shop that wasn't open, a complaint line about excessive queuing, and what turned out to be a group of people standing near each other coincidentally.

The highlight was joining what I thought was a queue for tea but was actually the line to join a queue-enthusiasts club. I'm now their honorary president. My campaign slogan? "Make Britain Queue Again." I didn't have the heart to tell them it never stopped.
