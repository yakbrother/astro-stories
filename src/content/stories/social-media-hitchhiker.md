I decided to become the world's first hitchhiking influencer. My plan was simple: document my journey with perfect filters, inspiring quotes, and the hashtag #ThumbLife. Reality had other plans.

My first viral moment came when I tried to film a "day in the life" video, but instead captured myself chasing my cardboard sign across six lanes of highway. The follow-up video of me retrieving my phone from a puddle while still maintaining "influencer pose" got even more views.

The crowning achievement was my livestream titled "Aesthetic Hitchhiking Tips" which consisted entirely of me standing in the rain for two hours, periodically shouting "Don't forget to like and subscribe!" to passing trucks. My only ride that day came from a social media consultant who spent the entire journey critiquing my hashtag strategy.

I've since pivoted to a new niche: "Anti-Influencer Influencing." Turns out, failing spectacularly on camera is much more entertaining than succeeding perfectly.
