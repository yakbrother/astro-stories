They say all roads lead to Rome, but nobody mentions that once you're there, all roads lead to chaos. I rented a Vespa, thinking it would make me look like Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. Instead, I looked more like Mr. Bean in a circus.

The traffic rules, as far as I could tell, were more like gentle suggestions. Red lights? Optional. Lane markers? Decorative. The only constant was the symphony of horns and hand gestures, which I'm pretty sure is how Romans communicate about their mothers' pasta recipes.

The final straw came when I tried to eat gelato while riding. Physics lesson: gelato melts faster at 30mph, and centrifugal force doesn't care about your white linen shirt. I now have a rainbow-colored reminder of why some things, like gelato and Vespas, are best enjoyed separately.
