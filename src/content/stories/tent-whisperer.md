I once convinced my friends I was a camping expert because I watched every episode of Bear Grylls. This worked perfectly until they invited me on an actual camping trip. My first red flag should have been when I tried to pitch the tent upside down, claiming it was "Australian style."

The situation deteriorated when I attempted to demonstrate my "tent whispering" technique - a completely made-up method where you supposedly communicate with the tent through interpretive dance. The tent responded by collapsing on me during a particularly enthusiastic twirl.

The final straw came when I tried to prove that my "special camping sense" could predict rain. I insisted everyone pack up immediately, citing my "tingling tent sense." It was a cloudless day, and we missed the most beautiful sunset of the year. I now stick to my true expertise: watching camping shows from my couch.
