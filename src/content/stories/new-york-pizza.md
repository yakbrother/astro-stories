I was warned about New York's pizza politics, but nothing prepared me for the truth. It all started when I committed the cardinal sin of asking for pineapple on my slice in Little Italy. The pizzaiolo's eyes narrowed, and he made a subtle hand gesture I would later learn was the secret signal of the Pizza Underground.

For the next week, I was followed by mysterious figures carrying pizza boxes. They would appear on street corners, in subway cars, even outside my hotel, always watching. I overheard coded conversations about "sauce ratios" and "fold angles."

I finally cracked when I witnessed a clandestine meeting between rival pizza families, arguing about the proper thickness of crust. I now know too much about the Five Boroughs' Pizza Consortium. If you're reading this, tell my family I love them, and never, ever eat pizza with a fork in Manhattan.
