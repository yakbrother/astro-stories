Determined to elevate the camping culinary experience, I packed an ambitious menu: truffle-infused mac and cheese, garlic-herb butter for artisanal s'mores, and locally sourced organic quinoa. What I didn't pack was common sense.

The trouble began when my aromatic cooking attracted a food critic I hadn't accounted for - a black bear with surprisingly refined tastes. As I watched this unexpected dinner guest sample my carefully curated cheese board, I realized that perhaps beans from a can weren't such a bad camping tradition after all.

The bear gave my truffle mac and cheese two paws up, though his review was slightly biased by also eating the camping stove. We ended up having premium granola bars for dinner - served in trees, with a garnish of pure terror. I now specialize in what I call "scent-free gourmet," also known as trail mix.
