I decided to revolutionize camping by turning my tent into a smart home. I installed solar-powered WiFi, automated temperature control, and a voice-activated everything. The promotional video looked great. The actual camping trip? Not so much.

The smart tent's AI assistant kept misinterpreting rustling leaves as intruders, triggering the emergency protocol: strobe lights and blasting "The Final Countdown" at full volume. Local wildlife filed several noise complaints.

The automated zip system trapped me inside for two hours because it detected "suspicious activity" (me trying to leave for a bathroom break). The final straw came when the smart coffee maker formed an alliance with the bear-detection system, resulting in every morning starting with both scalding coffee and a false bear alarm.

I've since returned to traditional camping, though I still sometimes wake up reaching for a non-existent smart tent snooze button.
