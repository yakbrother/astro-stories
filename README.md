## Customizing the theme

Add your name, website url, and other information in the src/profile.ts file. This will be used throughout the site and added to social media links.

Most of the visual customization is done in the `src/styles/global.css` file. Fonts are uploaded in the `public/fonts/` folder and specified in the `src/styles/fonts.css` file. [Webfont Generator](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) is an excellent tool for adding custom fonts to your site.

The favicons were created with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
|   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
|   â””â”€â”€profile.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal. Substitute `yarn` or `vlt` for `npm` if you use a different package manager.

| Command                   | Action                                           |
